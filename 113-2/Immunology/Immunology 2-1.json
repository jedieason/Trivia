    },
    "answer": ["A", "B"],
    "explanation": "(A) and (B) are correct. IgG1 indeed has two heavy and two light chains, and interchain disulfide bonds are crucial for linking them.

            "B": "It neutralizes TNFα to reduce inflammation in cancer patients.",
            "C": "It blocks PD-1, an inhibitory receptor on T cells, to enhance anti-tumor immune responses.",
            "D": "It delivers cytotoxic drugs specifically to tumor cells.",
            "E": "It activates complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against tumor cells."
        },
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "(C) Nivolumab is a PD-1 blocking antibody. PD-1 is an inhibitory receptor on T cells, and blocking it releases the brakes on T cell activity, enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. (A) Rituximab targets B cells. (B) Infliximab targets TNFα. (D) Antibody-drug conjugates use different mechanisms. (E) CDC is a different effector mechanism, not Nivolumab’s mode of action."

        "question": "Which therapeutic antibody mentioned, Infliximab, is used to treat autoimmune diseases by targeting which cytokine?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2)",
            "B": "Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα)",

            "E": "Interferon-gamma (IFNγ)"
        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "(B) Infliximab targets and neutralizes Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα), a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, and is used to treat various autoimmune diseases. (A), (C), (D), (E) are other cytokines, but TNFα is the target for Infliximab as per the provided text."
