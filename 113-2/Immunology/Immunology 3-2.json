      "B": "To stabilize MHC class II molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum.",
      "C": "To prevent MHC class II molecules from binding peptides in the ER and direct them to endosomes.",
      "D": "To facilitate peptide loading onto MHC class II molecules in endosomes.",
      "E": "To promote the surface expression of MHC class II molecules on APCs."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) The invariant chain (Ii) has several critical functions in MHC class II antigen presentation. Most importantly, it prevents MHC class II molecules from binding peptides prematurely in the endoplasmic reticulum by occupying the peptide-binding groove. It also assists in the proper folding and transport of MHC class II molecules from the ER to endosomes, where peptide loading should occur."

    "question": "What is the functional outcome of PLC-γ (Phospholipase C gamma) activation in TCR signaling?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Activation of RAS and MAPK pathway.",
      "B": "Production of IP3 and DAG, leading to calcium release from the ER and activation of protein kinase C (PKC).",
      "C": "Recruitment of adaptor proteins to the LAT signalosome.",
      "D": "Phosphorylation of ITAMs within the CD3 complex.",
      "E": "Promotion of actin polymerization and cytoskeletal changes."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "(B) PLC-γ (Phospholipase C gamma) is activated downstream of LAT phosphorylation in TCR signaling. Activated PLC-γ hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 induces the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). These second messengers are crucial for downstream signaling events leading to T cell activation."

    "question": "Which of the following factors contributes most significantly to the extensive polymorphism observed in MHC genes?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Somatic recombination.",
      "B": "Class switch recombination.",
      "C": "Gene conversion and point mutations accumulated over evolutionary time, driven by selection pressure from pathogens.",
      "D": "Transcriptional regulation.",
      "E": "Epigenetic modifications."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) The high degree of polymorphism in MHC genes is primarily attributed to gene conversion and point mutations that have accumulated over evolutionary time. This genetic diversity is strongly driven by selection pressure from pathogens. Different MHC alleles can bind and present different sets of peptides derived from pathogens. Individuals with diverse MHC alleles are more likely to survive and reproduce in the face of evolving pathogens, leading to the maintenance of MHC polymorphism in populations."

    "question": "What is the role of ERp57 in the peptide loading complex (PLC) during MHC class I assembly?",
    "options": {
      "A": "To transport peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum.",
      "B": "To stabilize MHC class I heavy chain and β2-microglobulin heterodimer.",
      "C": "To act as a thiol reductase that assists in proper folding of MHC class I molecules and peptide binding.",

      "E": "To remove misfolded MHC class I molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) ERp57 (Endoplasmic Reticulum protein 57 kDa) is a thiol reductase that is a component of the peptide loading complex (PLC). It assists in the proper folding of MHC class I heavy chains and β2-microglobulin and is involved in disulfide bond formation and reduction, which are crucial for MHC class I conformation and peptide binding."

    "question": "Which of the following describes the mechanism by which superantigens activate T cells?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Superantigens bind directly to the peptide-binding groove of MHC class II molecules, presenting themselves as antigens.",
      "B": "Superantigens are processed and presented as peptides by MHC class I molecules to CD8+ T cells.",
      "C": "Superantigens crosslink MHC class II molecules on APCs and the Vβ region of the T cell receptor outside the peptide-binding groove, leading to polyclonal T cell activation.",
      "D": "Superantigens block the interaction between TCR and pMHC, leading to T cell inactivation.",
      "E": "Superantigens require co-stimulation through CD28-B7 interaction to activate T cells, similar to conventional antigens."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) Superantigens have a unique mechanism of T cell activation. They bind simultaneously to MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and the Vβ region of the T cell receptor (TCR) β chain. This interaction occurs outside the conventional peptide-binding groove and bypasses the need for specific peptide-MHC recognition. This crosslinking activates a large proportion of T cells bearing particular Vβ regions, leading to a polyclonal T cell response and massive cytokine release."

    "question": "What is the functional significance of the ITAMs (Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs) present in the cytoplasmic tails of CD3 molecules?",
    "options": {
      "A": "To bind to peptide-MHC complexes.",
      "B": "To interact with co-stimulatory receptors like CD28.",

      "E": "To regulate the surface expression of TCR-CD3 complex."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) ITAMs (Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs) are crucial signaling motifs found in the cytoplasmic tails of CD3 molecules (γ, δ, ε, and ζ chains) and also CD79a/b of the B cell receptor. Upon TCR engagement and LCK activation, ITAMs are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. These phosphorylated ITAMs then act as docking sites for tyrosine kinases like ZAP-70 (in T cells) or Syk (in B cells), which are recruited to the complex and become activated, initiating downstream signaling cascades leading to lymphocyte activation."

    "question": "Which of the following is a key difference between the antigens presented by MHC class I and MHC class II molecules?",
    "options": {
      "A": "MHC class I presents only peptide antigens, while MHC class II presents only non-peptide antigens.",
      "B": "MHC class I presents antigens derived from extracellular pathogens, while MHC class II presents antigens from intracellular pathogens.",
      "C": "MHC class I primarily presents antigens derived from cytosolic proteins (e.g., viral proteins), while MHC class II presents antigens derived from proteins internalized from the extracellular environment (e.g., bacterial proteins).",
      "D": "MHC class I presents antigens to CD4+ T cells, while MHC class II presents antigens to CD8+ T cells.",
      "E": "MHC class I presentation requires TAP, while MHC class II presentation does not."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) A fundamental difference is the source of antigens. MHC class I pathway typically presents peptides derived from proteins in the cytosol, such as viral proteins or tumor antigens. MHC class II pathway primarily presents peptides derived from proteins taken up from the extracellular environment, such as bacterial antigens or toxins."

    "question": "What is the role of HLA-DM in editing the peptide repertoire presented by MHC class II molecules?",
    "options": {
      "A": "HLA-DM enhances the degradation of low-affinity peptides in endosomes.",
      "B": "HLA-DM promotes the binding of high-affinity peptides to MHC class II by facilitating the release of CLIP and other weakly bound peptides, thus 'editing' the peptide repertoire.",
      "C": "HLA-DM stabilizes MHC class II molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing peptide binding.",
      "D": "HLA-DM facilitates the transport of MHC class II-peptide complexes from endosomes to the cell surface.",
      "E": "HLA-DM increases the overall expression of MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "(B) HLA-DM acts as a peptide editor in the MHC class II pathway. It does not directly load peptides onto MHC class II. Instead, it promotes the release of CLIP and other weakly bound peptides from MHC class II molecules in endosomes. This allows higher affinity peptides, which are more likely to elicit a relevant immune response, to bind and stabilize the MHC class II molecule. By favoring high-affinity peptide binding, HLA-DM effectively edits the peptide repertoire presented by MHC class II."

    "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of the TCR signaling pathway that ensures T cell activation is tightly regulated and not easily triggered by self-antigens?",
    "options": {
      "A": "TCR signaling requires only signal 1 (TCR-pMHC interaction) for full activation.",
      "B": "TCR signaling is initiated even in the absence of antigen stimulation.",
      "C": "TCR signaling requires two signals: signal 1 (TCR-pMHC) for specificity and signal 2 (co-stimulation) for full activation and prevention of anergy.",
      "D": "TCR signaling is primarily regulated by inhibitory receptors, not co-stimulatory receptors.",
      "E": "TCR signaling is independent of intracellular tyrosine kinases like LCK and ZAP-70."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) The 'two-signal' model of T cell activation is a critical mechanism for ensuring immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. Signal 1 (TCR-pMHC interaction) provides antigen specificity, but signal 2 (co-stimulation, e.g., CD28-B7 interaction) is essential for full T cell activation, proliferation, and effector function. Without signal 2, TCR engagement alone can lead to T cell anergy or apoptosis, contributing to self-tolerance."

    "question": "How does cross-presentation differ from the conventional MHC class I antigen presentation pathway?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cross-presentation involves presentation of extracellular antigens by MHC class II molecules, unlike conventional MHC class I pathway.",
      "B": "Cross-presentation is a pathway in which certain antigen-presenting cells (primarily dendritic cells) can present extracellular antigens on MHC class I molecules to CD8+ T cells, typically antigens are presented on MHC class I from cytosolic sources.",
      "C": "Cross-presentation is a mechanism for presenting self-antigens on MHC class I molecules, while conventional MHC class I pathway presents foreign antigens.",
      "D": "Cross-presentation does not require TAP for peptide loading onto MHC class I molecules.",
      "E": "Cross-presentation occurs exclusively in B lymphocytes, whereas conventional MHC class I presentation occurs in all nucleated cells."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "(B) Cross-presentation, also known as cross-priming, is a specialized pathway mainly performed by dendritic cells. It enables these APCs to present extracellular antigens, which are typically processed for MHC class II presentation, on MHC class I molecules. This is crucial for initiating CD8+ T cell responses against pathogens that do not directly infect APCs, such as viruses that infect non-APCs or tumor cells."

      "D": "Allelic exclusion.",
      "E": "Isotype switching."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) The extensive genetic diversity of MHC genes, characterized by polymorphism (multiple alleles for each MHC gene within a population) and polygeny (multiple distinct MHC class I and class II genes), is critical for population-level immunity. This diversity ensures that, within a population, there will be individuals capable of presenting a wide range of pathogen-derived peptides, enhancing the overall ability of the population to respond to diverse and evolving pathogens."

  {
    "question": "What is the role of autophagy in MHC class II antigen presentation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Autophagy is a pathway for degrading cytosolic proteins for MHC class I presentation, not MHC class II.",
      "B": "Autophagy delivers extracellular antigens into endosomes for MHC class II loading.",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) Autophagy, a cellular self-degradative process, can play a role in MHC class II antigen presentation. Autophagy can engulf cytosolic components, including intracellular pathogens (like bacteria or viruses residing in the cytoplasm) or self-antigens, and deliver these contents to lysosomes. Within lysosomes, these engulfed materials are degraded, and the resulting peptides can then be loaded onto MHC class II molecules for presentation to CD4+ T cells. This pathway is particularly important for presenting antigens derived from intracellular pathogens or self-antigens that are not accessible through the endocytic pathway."

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) CD4 and CD8 co-receptors play a crucial role in enhancing TCR signaling. CD4 binds to the β2 domain of MHC class II molecules, and CD8 binds to the α3 domain of MHC class I molecules. By binding to MHC molecules, CD4 and CD8 bring the associated Src family kinase LCK (which is physically associated with the cytoplasmic tails of CD4 and CD8) into close proximity to the TCR-CD3 complex upon TCR engagement. This proximity facilitates efficient phosphorylation of ITAMs on the CD3 complex by LCK, initiating downstream signaling events."
