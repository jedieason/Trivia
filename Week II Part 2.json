      "D": "They are commonly used in clinical settings due to their low toxicity."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Suicide inhibitors are mechanism-based inhibitors that require activation by the target enzyme, leading to the formation of a reactive intermediate that irreversibly inactivates the enzyme."

    "question": "What is the advantage of using suicide inhibitors in drug development?",
    "options": {
      "A": "They are readily available and inexpensive to produce.",
      "B": "They can be easily reversed if necessary.",
      "C": "They exhibit high specificity for their target enzymes, minimizing side effects.",
      "D": "They have a long half-life in the body, reducing the frequency of administration."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Suicide inhibitors are highly specific for their target enzymes, minimizing the risk of off-target effects and improving their safety profile as drugs."

  {
    "question": "Which compound is mentioned as an example of a suicide inhibitor that targets ornithine decarboxylase?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ethanol",
      "B": "Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP)",
      "C": "DFMO",
      "D": "ATP"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "DFMO is a suicide inhibitor that targets ornithine decarboxylase, exploiting the enzyme's catalytic mechanism to irreversibly inactivate it."
