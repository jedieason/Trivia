      "B": "Inattentional blindness is the failure to see stimuli that are directly in front of our eyes due to a lack of attention, while change blindness is the failure to notice a change in the environment.",
      "C": "Inattentional blindness is a visual illusion, while change blindness is a memory problem.",
      "D": "Inattentional blindness occurs when we are distracted, while change blindness occurs when we are not paying attention.",
      "E": "There is no difference; they are the same phenomenon."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Inattentional blindness occurs when we fail to see something because our attention is focused elsewhere. Change blindness occurs when we fail to notice a change in our environment, even if we are looking directly at it."

      "E": "About 1 hour."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Visual sensory memory, also known as iconic memory, fades very rapidly, typically within a third of a second. This fleeting nature of visual sensory memory was demonstrated by Sperling's partial report experiment."

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between short-term memory (STM) and working memory?",
    "options": {
      "A": "STM is a passive storage system, while working memory is an active processing system.",
      "B": "STM holds information for longer periods of time than working memory.",

    },
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Due to its limited capacity, the arrival of new information into a full short-term memory leads to the displacement or loss of older information that was previously being held."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is chunking in memory?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Repeating information over and over again to keep it in short-term memory.",

      "E": "By reducing the effects of interference on memory."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Rehearsal, the act of repeatedly thinking about or verbalizing information, helps to maintain it in short-term memory and increases the likelihood of that information being encoded into long-term memory."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Semantic memory is our storehouse of general knowledge, concepts, and facts about the world. It is not tied to specific personal experiences or events."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is episodic memory?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Memory for facts and general knowledge.",
      "B": "Memory for personal experiences and events.",
      "C": "Memory for skills and procedures.",
      "D": "Memory for emotional responses.",
      "E": "Memory for future intentions."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Episodic memory allows us to mentally travel back in time and re-experience past personal events. It provides a sense of our personal history and identity."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is prospective memory?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Memory for past events.",
      "B": "Memory for facts and general knowledge.",
      "C": "Memory for skills and procedures.",
      "D": "Memory for future intentions and actions.",
      "E": "Memory for emotional responses."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Prospective memory is our ability to remember to perform actions in the future. It involves remembering to remember, which can be challenging as it requires self-monitoring and initiative."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is retrospective memory?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Memory for future intentions and actions.",
      "B": "Memory for past events and information.",
      "C": "Memory for facts and general knowledge.",
      "D": "Memory for skills and procedures.",
      "E": "Memory for emotional responses."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Retrospective memory encompasses our ability to recall information and events from the past. It includes both episodic memory (personal experiences) and semantic memory (general knowledge)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What key insight about memory did the study of Patient H.M. (Henry Molaison) provide?",
    "options": {
      "A": "That short-term memory and long-term memory are distinct systems.",
      "B": "That the hippocampus plays a crucial role in the formation of new long-term memories.",
      "C": "That procedural memory (skills and habits) can be preserved even when declarative memory (facts and events) is impaired.",
      "D": "All of the above."
      "E": "None of the above."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "H.M.'s case was pivotal in understanding memory. His inability to form new long-term memories after the removal of parts of his hippocampus revealed the hippocampus's importance in memory consolidation. Furthermore, his preserved ability to learn new skills despite severe declarative memory impairment demonstrated the separate nature of procedural and declarative memory systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific brain structure is critically involved in the initial consolidation of memories, as evidenced by Patient H.M.'s case?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Amygdala",
      "B": "Cerebellum",
      "C": "Prefrontal cortex",
      "D": "Hippocampus",
      "E": "Thalamus"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The surgery performed on H.M. to alleviate his seizures involved removing portions of his hippocampus. This resulted in his profound inability to form new long-term memories, highlighting the hippocampus's crucial role in memory consolidation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which type of memory remained intact for Patient H.M. despite his inability to form new long-term declarative memories?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Episodic memory",
      "B": "Semantic memory",
      "C": "Prospective memory",
      "D": "Procedural memory",
      "E": "Flashbulb memory"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Despite his profound impairment in forming new declarative memories (facts and events), H.M. retained the ability to learn and improve on new motor skills. This preserved procedural memory demonstrated the existence of different memory systems in the brain."

  {
    "question": "What significant contribution did Brenda Milner make to the understanding of memory?",
    "options": {
      "A": "She developed the first comprehensive theory of memory.",
      "B": "She discovered the role of the hippocampus in memory.",
      "C": "She conducted groundbreaking research on Patient H.M., leading to major discoveries about different memory systems.",
      "D": "She invented the first memory-enhancing drug.",
      "E": "She developed the concept of the forgetting curve."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Brenda Milner's extensive work with H.M. was instrumental in advancing our understanding of memory. Her studies revealed the distinctions between short-term and long-term memory and the different brain regions involved in various types of memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the legacy of Patient H.M. in the field of neuroscience?",
    "options": {
      "A": "His case revolutionized our understanding of the biological basis of memory.",
      "B": "His brain became one of the most studied brains in history, contributing immensely to memory research.",
      "C": "His story highlights the ethical considerations involved in brain surgery and research.",
      "D": "All of the above."
      "E": "None of the above."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "H.M.'s case had a profound and lasting impact on neuroscience. His unique condition provided invaluable insights into the complexities of memory, leading to a deeper understanding of its biological underpinnings and ethical considerations surrounding research and treatment."
