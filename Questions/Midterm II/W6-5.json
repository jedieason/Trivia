"question": "Which of the following is a potential consequence of a deficiency in the enzyme ornithine transcarbamoylase?",
"options": {
"A": "Accumulation of ammonia in the blood.",
"B": "Decreased synthesis of citrulline.",
"C": "Increased production of urea.",
"D": "Enhanced excretion of nitrogenous waste.",
"E": "None of the above."
},
"answer": "A",
"explanation": "A deficiency in ornithine transcarbamoylase, a key enzyme in the urea cycle, impairs the conversion of carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline. This leads to the buildup of ammonia, which can have toxic effects on the body, particularly the brain."

"question": "Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of the amino acid glutamine?",
"options": {
"A": "It is synthesized from glutamate and ammonia.",
"B": "It is a non-toxic carrier of ammonia in the blood.",
"C": "It is the primary nitrogenous waste product excreted in the urine.",
"D": "It is a precursor for the synthesis of neurotransmitters.",
"E": "It can be used as an energy source by some cells."
},
"answer": "C",
"explanation": "While glutamine plays a crucial role in ammonia detoxification and transport, it is not the primary nitrogenous waste product excreted in urine. Urea is the major nitrogenous waste product in mammals."
