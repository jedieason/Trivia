  {
    "question": "Which of the following pairs correctly matches the oil with its relative content of saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Palm oil: High in saturated fatty acids, low in monounsaturated fatty acids, high in polyunsaturated fatty acids",
      "B": "Olive oil: High in monounsaturated fatty acids, low in saturated fatty acids, moderate in polyunsaturated fatty acids",
      "C": "Soybean oil: Low in saturated fatty acids, high in monounsaturated fatty acids, low in polyunsaturated fatty acids",
      "D": "Sunflower oil: Moderate in saturated fatty acids, high in monounsaturated fatty acids, low in polyunsaturated fatty acids",
      "E": "Coconut oil: Low in saturated fatty acids, moderate in monounsaturated fatty acids, high in polyunsaturated fatty acids"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Olive oil is known for its high monounsaturated fatty acid content, particularly oleic acid, with lower amounts of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do oils rich in unsaturated fatty acids contain higher levels of vitamin E?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Vitamin E is intentionally added to these oils during processing.",
      "B": "Unsaturated fatty acids enhance the absorption of vitamin E from the diet.",
      "C": "Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting the unsaturated fatty acids from oxidation.",
      "D": "Vitamin E is a byproduct of unsaturated fatty acid synthesis.",
      "E": "There is no relationship between unsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E content."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The presence of multiple double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids makes them susceptible to oxidation. Vitamin E, a potent antioxidant, helps protect these oils from oxidative damage."
