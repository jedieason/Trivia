"options": {
"A": "They compete with glutamine for binding sites on PRPP synthase.",
"B": "They inhibit the enzymes responsible for converting glutamine to glutamate.",
"C": "They mimic glutamine, disrupting specific steps in the purine synthesis pathway.",
"D": "They directly bind to and degrade purine nucleotides.",
"E": "They prevent the uptake of glutamine into cells."
},
"answer": "C",
"explanation": "Glutamine analogs, as their name suggests, are structurally similar to glutamine. This structural similarity allows them to interfere with specific steps in the purine synthesis pathway where glutamine is required, acting as competitive inhibitors."

"question": "Which enzyme in purine synthesis is inhibited by 6-Mercaptopurine?",
"options": {
"A": "PRPP synthase",
"B": "IMP dehydrogenase",
"C": "Adenylosuccinate synthetase",
"D": "GMP synthetase",
"E": "Xanthine oxidase"
},
"answer": "B",
"explanation": "The sources state that 6-Mercaptopurine specifically targets steps 13 and 14 in purine synthesis. While the specific enzymes for these steps aren't named, it's likely that 6-Mercaptopurine interferes with IMP dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the conversion of IMP to GMP."

{
"question": "What step in purine synthesis is targeted by Mycophenolic acid?",
"options": {
"A": "Step 1",
"B": "Step 5",
"C": "Step 10",
"D": "Step 14",
"E": "Step 20"
},
"answer": "D",
"explanation": "The text indicates that Mycophenolic acid specifically inhibits Step 14 in purine synthesis. While the exact enzymatic reaction isn't described, this suggests that Mycophenolic acid disrupts a late-stage step in the pathway."
