"B": "A disorder caused by a deficiency in HGPRT, leading to the accumulation of orotic acid.",
"C": "A symptom of Von Gierke disease, resulting from the overproduction of orotic acid.",
"D": "A side effect of Allopurinol treatment, caused by its inhibition of orotic acid breakdown.",
"E": "A rare genetic disorder that prevents the absorption of orotic acid from the diet."
},
"answer": "A",
"explanation": "Orotic aciduria is a condition where defects in pyrimidine synthesis, specifically in the enzymes Orotate phosphoribosyl transferase and/or Orotidylate decarboxylase, lead to the accumulation and excessive excretion of orotic acid in the urine."
},
{
"question": "What are the two types of Orotic aciduria and how do they differ?",
"options": {
"A": "Type I involves a deficiency in both Orotate phosphoribosyl transferase and Orotidylate decarboxylase, while Type II only affects Orotidylate decarboxylase.",
"B": "Type I is caused by dietary factors, while Type II is a genetic disorder.",
"C": "Type I is more severe than Type II.",
"D": "Type I affects primarily children, while Type II is more common in adults.",
"E": "There is no difference; both types have the same underlying cause and symptoms."
},
"answer": "A",
"explanation": "Orotic aciduria is classified into two types: Type I is characterized by a deficiency in both Orotate phosphoribosyl transferase and Orotidylate decarboxylase, whereas Type II only involves a deficiency in Orotidylate decarboxylase."
},
{
"question": "How can certain medications, such as Allopurinol, contribute to the development of Orotic aciduria?",
"options": {
"A": "By inhibiting Orotate phosphoribosyl transferase, preventing the conversion of orotic acid to OMP.",
"B": "By directly inhibiting pyrimidine synthesis.",
"C": "By promoting the breakdown of pyrimidine nucleotides.",
"D": "By interfering with the absorption of orotic."
