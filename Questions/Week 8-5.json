"B": "Enhanced cognitive function",
"C": "Reduced risk of cancer",
"D": "Relief from depression, liver disease, and osteoarthritis",
"E": "Increased muscle mass and strength"
},
"answer": "D",
"explanation": "S-Adenosylmethionine is marketed as a dietary supplement with claims of alleviating depression, supporting liver health, and easing osteoarthritis symptoms."

"question": "Which of the following is NOT a common coenzyme derived from AMP?",
"options": {
"A": "NAD+",
"B": "FAD",
"C": "Coenzyme A",
"D": "ATP",
"E": "cAMP"
},
"answer": "D",
"explanation": "While ATP is a nucleotide, it is not considered a coenzyme derived from AMP. The other options (NAD+, FAD, Coenzyme A, and cAMP) are all derived from AMP and function as coenzymes in various metabolic reactions."

{
"question": "What type of bond contributes to the high energy content of phosphate groups in nucleotides?",
"options": {
"A": "Ester bond",
"B": "Ether bond",
"C": "Glycosidic bond",
"D": "Hydrogen bond",
"E": "Anhydride bond"
},
"answer": "E",
"explanation": "The anhydride bond, formed by dehydration between phosphate groups, stores a significant amount of energy, which is released upon hydrolysis. This characteristic makes nucleotides like ATP essential for cellular energy transfer."

"B": "3.4 kcal/mol",
"C": "7.3 kcal/mol",
"D": "10.9 kcal/mol",
"E": "15.6 kcal/mol"
},
"answer": "C",
"explanation": "The hydrolysis of one phosphate group from ATP releases approximately 7."}
