"D": "Elevated levels of Argininosuccinate",
"E": "Reduced synthesis of Arginine"
},
"answer": "B",
"explanation": "N-Acetylglutamate synthase deficiency leads to insufficient production of N-Acetylglutamate, which is necessary for the activation of the first enzyme in the urea cycle, Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I."
},
{
"question": "What accumulates in the body due to a deficiency in Argininosuccinate synthetase?",
"options": {
"A": "Ornithine",
"B": "Citrulline",
"C": "Argininosuccinate",
"D": "Arginine",
"E": "Fumarate"
},
"answer": "B",
"explanation": "Citrullinemia arises from a lack of Argininosuccinate synthetase, leading to the accumulation of Citrulline."
},
{
"question": "Which enzyme is responsible for the hydrolysis of Arg to produce urea and Ornithine?",
"options": {
"A": "Ornithine transcarbamoylase",
"B": "Argininosuccinate synthetase",
"C": "Argininosuccinase",
"D": "Arginase",
"E": "Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I"
},
"answer": "D",
"explanation": "Arginase plays a crucial role in the final step of the urea cycle by hydrolyzing Arg to generate urea and Ornithine."
},
{
"question": "What condition involves the accumulation of Ornithine and NH4+ due to a malfunctioning Ornithine permease?",
"options": {
"A": "Hyperammonemia type 1",
"B": "Hyperammonemia type 2",
"C": "HHH syndrome",
"D": "Citrullinemia",
"E": "Argininosuccinicaciduria"
},
"answer": "C",
"explanation": "HHH syndrome is characterized by a dysfunctional Ornithine permease, leading to the buildup of Ornithine (Hyperornithinemia) and NH4+ (Hyperammonemia)."
},
{
"question": "What compound is formed when Carbamoyl phosphate reacts with Lysine in the absence of Ornithine?",
"options": {
"A": "Citrulline",
"B": "Argininosuccinate",
"C": "Arginine",
"D": "Homocitrulline",
"E": "Fumarate"
},
"answer": "D",
"explanation": "In HHH syndrome, the lack of Ornithine in the mitochondria forces Carbamoyl phosphate to react with Lysine, resulting in the formation of Homocitrulline."
},
{
"question": "What is the primary goal of treatment for urea cycle disorders?",
"options": {
"A": "Stimulate enzyme production",
"B": "Replace deficient enzymes",
"C": "Reduce ammonia levels",
"D": "Increase protein intake",
"E": "Supplement with essential amino acids"
},
"answer": "C",
"explanation": "The main objective of treatment for urea cycle disorders is to lower ammonia levels, as their accumulation is harmful."
},
{
"question": "Which amino acids are targeted for modification in the treatment of urea cycle disorders?",
"options": {
"A": "Gly and Ala",
"B": "Gly and Gln",
"C": "Ala and Gln",
"D": "Lys and Arg",
"E": "Citrulline and Argininosuccinate"
},
"answer": "B",
"explanation": "The therapeutic approach for urea cycle disorders involves modifying Gly and Gln to create compounds that can be excreted in urine."
},
{
"question": "What role does CoA-SH play in the treatment of urea cycle disorders?",
"options": {
"A": "Inhibits ammonia production",
"B": "Activates urea cycle enzymes",
"C": "Facilitates amino acid conjugation with drugs",
"D": "Promotes renal excretion of ammonia",
"E": "Converts ammonia to less toxic substances"
},
"answer": "C",
"explanation": "CoA-SH is essential in the treatment of urea cycle disorders as it aids in the conjugation of amino acids (Gly and Gln) with the administered drugs."
},
{
"question": "What compound is formed when Benzoate reacts with Glycine?",
"options": {
"A": "Hippurate",
"B": "Phenylacetylglutamine",
"C": "Benzoyl-CoA",
"D": "Phenylacetyl-CoA",
"E": "Ornithine"
},
"answer": "A",
"explanation": "Benzoate combines with CoA-SH to form Benzoyl-CoA, which then reacts with Glycine to produce Hippurate, a compound that can be eliminated through urine."
},
{
"question": "Which drug is used to conjugate with Glutamine in the treatment of urea cycle disorders?",
"options": {
"A": "Benzoate",
"B": "Phenylbutyrate",
"C": "Arginine",
"D": "Citrulline",
"E": "Ornithine"
},
"answer": "B",
"explanation": "Phenylbutyrate is employed to conjugate with Glutamine. It first reacts with CoA-SH to form Phenylacetyl-CoA, which then combines with Glutamine, resulting in Phenylacetylglutamine that is excreted in urine."
},
{
"question": "Why are modified amino acids excreted in urine?",
"options": {
"A": "They are toxic to the body.",
"B": "They are not recognized by renal transporters for reabsorption.",
"C": "They exceed the renal threshold for reabsorption.",
"D": "They are actively secreted into the urine.",
"E": "They are broken down into smaller molecules that are easily excreted."
},
"answer": "B",
"explanation": "The modified amino acids are not recognized by the transporter proteins responsible for reabsorbing amino acids in the kidneys, leading to their excretion in urine."
