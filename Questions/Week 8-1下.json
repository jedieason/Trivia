    "question": "What is the primary role of leukotrienes in the immune system?",
    "options": {
      "A": "To suppress inflammation",
      "B": "To promote antibody production",
      "C": "To activate T cells",
      "D": "To mediate allergic and inflammatory responses",
      "E": "To inhibit pathogen recognition"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Leukotrienes are potent mediators of allergic and inflammatory responses, contributing to bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, and immune cell recruitment."

    "question": "Which condition can be exacerbated by essential fatty acid deficiency?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Obesity",
      "B": "Diabetes",
      "C": "Skin lesions and impaired lipid transport",
      "D": "Hypertension",
      "E": "Hypoglycemia"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Essential fatty acid deficiency can manifest in skin problems and difficulties with lipid transport due to the roles of essential fatty acids in membrane structure and function."

    "question": "Which of the following is NOT a health concern associated with trans fatty acid consumption?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Increased risk of cardiovascular disease",
      "B": "Exacerbation of essential fatty acid deficiency",
      "C": "Lowering of LDL cholesterol levels",
      "D": "Elevation of triglyceride levels",
      "E": "Promotion of inflammation"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Trans fatty acids, commonly found in processed foods, are known to increase LDL cholesterol levels, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease."

  {
    "question": "What is the rationale for developing NSAIDs that specifically target COX-2?",
    "options": {
      "A": "To enhance the production of beneficial prostaglandins",
      "B": "To reduce gastrointestinal side effects associated with COX-1 inhibition",
      "C": "To increase the risk of cardiovascular events",
      "D": "To promote platelet aggregation",
      "E": "To suppress the immune response"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "COX-1 is involved in protecting the stomach lining, and its inhibition by NSAIDs can lead to gastrointestinal irritation. Developing COX-2-specific inhibitors aims to reduce these side effects."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is NOT a potential therapeutic application of prostaglandins?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Treatment of inflammation",
      "B": "Blood pressure regulation",
      "C": "Induction of sleep",
      "D": "Stimulation of hair growth",
      "E": "Contraception"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Prostaglandins are involved in various physiological processes, and their therapeutic applications include the treatment of inflammation, blood pressure regulation, and contraception. PGD2 is also known to promote sleep."

  {
    "question": "How are leukotrienes involved in asthma?",
    "options": {
      "A": "They relax bronchial smooth muscle",
      "B": "They reduce mucus production in the airways",
      "C": "They inhibit inflammatory cell recruitment",
      "D": "They contribute to bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation",
      "E": "They suppress the immune response in the lungs"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "In asthma, leukotrienes contribute to the pathophysiology by promoting bronchoconstriction, increasing mucus secretion, and enhancing airway inflammation."
