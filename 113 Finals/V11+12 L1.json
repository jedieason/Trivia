"question": "What is the difference between a genotype and a phenotype?",
"options": {
"A": "Genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an organism, while phenotype refers to the observable characteristics of an organism.",
"B": "Genotype is determined by the environment, while phenotype is determined by genes.",
"C": "Genotype is expressed only in homozygous individuals, while phenotype is expressed in both homozygous and heterozygous individuals.",
"D": "Genotype is the result of translation, while phenotype is the result of transcription.",
"E": "Genotype and phenotype are synonymous terms."
},
"answer": "A",
"explanation": "Genotype represents the genetic composition of an individual, while phenotype describes the outward expression of those genes. The phenotype is influenced by both the genotype and environmental factors."

"question": "Which of the following statements about gene regulation is true?",
"options": {
"A": "Gene regulation ensures that genes are expressed only when and where they are needed.",
"B": "Gene regulation allows cells to respond to changes in their environment.",
"C": "Gene regulation is essential for cell differentiation and development.",
"D": "Dysregulation of gene expression can lead to diseases such as cancer.",
"E": "All of the above"
},
"answer": "E",
"explanation": "Gene regulation is a fundamental process that governs the expression of genes in a precise and controlled manner. It is essential for a wide range of cellular processes, from basic metabolism to development and disease."

"question": "Which of the following is a potential consequence of a mutation in a gene encoding a transcription factor?",
"options": {
"A": "The transcription factor may be unable to bind to its target DNA sequence.",
"B": "The transcription factor may lose its ability to activate or repress transcription.",
"C": "The expression of genes regulated by the transcription factor may be altered.",
"D": "The mutation may have no effect on the function of the transcription factor.",
"E": "All of the above"
},
"answer": "E",
"explanation": "Mutations in transcription factors can have a wide range of consequences, from disrupting DNA binding to altering their regulatory function. These changes can significantly impact the expression of genes under their control."
