"A": "Silent mutation",
"B": "Missense mutation",
"C": "Nonsense mutation",
"D": "Frameshift mutation",
"E": "Point mutation"
},
"answer": "B",
"explanation": "Missense mutations arise from a change in the DNA sequence that leads to the incorporation of a different amino acid into the protein. The impact of a missense mutation on protein function depends on the chemical properties of the original and substituted amino acids and their location within the protein."
},
{
"question": "Which type of mutation leads to the formation of a truncated protein due to the introduction of a premature stop codon?",
"options": {
"A": "Silent mutation",
"B": "Missense mutation",

},
"answer": "A",
"explanation": "Researchers can introduce nonsense mutations into genes to generate truncated proteins, allowing them to study the effects of protein truncation on cellular functions and phenotypes. This approach helps in elucidating the roles of specific protein domains and their importance in various biological processes."
},
{
"question": "What is the phenomenon called when the ribosome deviates from the standard reading frame during translation?",

"explanation": "The viral gag protein, a structural component of some viruses, is often produced through translational frameshifting. This mechanism enables the synthesis of both the shorter gag protein and a longer polymerase protein from the same mRNA sequence, optimizing the production of proteins needed in different quantities."
},
{
"question": "What are two main factors that contribute to translational frameshifting?",
"options": {
"A": "High GC content in mRNA and abundant tRNA availability",

"E": "To signal the termination of protein synthesis."
},
"answer": "D",
"explanation": "The slippery sequence, rich in adenine (A) and uracil (U) nucleotides, allows for alternative base pairing with the tRNA in the ribosome. This altered pairing, along with the presence of a downstream secondary structure, can induce a -1 frameshift, enabling the production of an extended protein."
},
{
"question": "How does the abundance of a particular tRNA molecule influence the likelihood of translational frameshifting?",
"options": {
"A": "Abundant tRNA molecules prevent frameshifting by ensuring rapid amino acid incorporation.",
