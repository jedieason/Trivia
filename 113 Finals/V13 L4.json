"explanation": "Heterochromatin, unlike euchromatin, is replicated late in the S phase of the cell cycle. This delayed replication is consistent with its condensed structure and generally inactive transcriptional state."

"question": "Which of the following steps in the N-linked glycosylation pathway occurs on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane?",
"options": {
"A": "Transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to dolichol phosphate",
"B": "Addition of mannose residues to the growing oligosaccharide chain",
"C": "Flipping of the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide into the ER lumen",
"D": "Transfer of the oligosaccharide chain to the asparagine residue of the protein",
"E": "Removal of glucose residues from the oligosaccharide after transfer to the protein"
},
"answer": "A",
"explanation": "The initial step in N-linked glycosylation, the transfer of GlcNAc to dolichol phosphate, takes place on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. Subsequent steps in the pathway, including the addition of mannose residues and the flipping of the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide, occur in the ER lumen."

"question": "Which of the following statements about the role of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in ensuring the fidelity of protein synthesis is true?",
"options": {
"A": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have proofreading mechanisms to correct mischarged tRNAs.",
"B": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases recognize only the anticodon of the tRNA and ignore the amino acid.",
"C": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are promiscuous enzymes that can attach any amino acid to any tRNA.",
"D": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases rely solely on the shape of the amino acid to ensure correct charging.",
"E": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases play no role in maintaining the accuracy of protein synthesis."
},
"answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases ensure the fidelity of protein synthesis by attaching the correct amino acid to its corresponding tRNA and employing proofreading mechanisms to detect and correct errors. This maintains the accuracy of translation by preventing mischarged tRNAs from incorporating incorrect amino acids into proteins."
