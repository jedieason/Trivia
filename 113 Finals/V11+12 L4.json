"answer": "B",
"explanation": "When the ribosome stalls at the Trp codons due to low tryptophan levels, it prevents the formation of the terminator hairpin structure. This allows RNA polymerase to continue transcribing the operon, leading to the production of enzymes needed for tryptophan biosynthesis."

"question": "What is the role of the regulatory gene in an operon?",
"options": {
"A": "It encodes for the structural proteins involved in the metabolic pathway.",
"B": "It encodes for a regulatory protein that controls the expression of the structural genes.",
"C": "It is the site where RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription.",
"D": "It is a DNA sequence that binds to the repressor protein.",
"E": "It is a small molecule that binds to the repressor protein and influences its activity."
},
"answer": "B",
"explanation": "The regulatory gene in an operon is responsible for producing a regulatory protein, typically a repressor or an activator, which governs the expression of the structural genes within the operon."

"question": "What is the difference between a trans-acting factor and a cis-acting element in gene regulation?",
"options": {
"A": "Trans-acting factors are proteins, while cis-acting elements are DNA sequences.",
"B": "Trans-acting factors bind to DNA, while cis-acting elements bind to proteins.",
"C": "Trans-acting factors can regulate genes on different DNA molecules, while cis-acting elements only regulate genes on the same DNA molecule.",
"D": "Trans-acting factors are involved in prokaryotic gene regulation, while cis-acting elements are involved in eukaryotic gene regulation.",
"E": "Trans-acting factors are specific to a particular gene, while cis-acting elements can regulate multiple genes."
},
"answer": "C",
"explanation": "Trans-acting factors, typically proteins, can diffuse and regulate genes located on different DNA molecules. Cis-acting elements are DNA sequences that exert their regulatory effects"
