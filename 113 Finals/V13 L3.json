    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "GTP (guanosine triphosphate) plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of G proteins. When bound to GTP, G proteins are in their active state. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP inactivates the G protein. This cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis acts as a molecular switch, controlling various cellular processes."
