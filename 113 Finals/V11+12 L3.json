    "question": "How does the 2' hydroxyl group contribute to RNA instability?",
    "options": {
      "A": "It facilitates base pairing.",
      "B": "It participates in hydrogen bonding.",
      "C": "It acts as a nucleophile, attacking the phosphate backbone.",
      "D": "It enhances the interaction with proteins.",
      "E": "It stabilizes the RNA tertiary structure."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The 2' hydroxyl group in RNA's ribose sugar can act as a nucleophile, attacking the phosphate group of the adjacent nucleotide. This leads to the formation of a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate, causing RNA strand breakage."
