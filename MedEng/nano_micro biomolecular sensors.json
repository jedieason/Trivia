"question": "How does a Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) biosensor function?",
"options": {
"A": "By measuring changes in the electrical resistance of a quartz crystal.",
"B": "By detecting the light emitted by biomolecules bound to a quartz surface.",
"C": "By monitoring changes in the resonant frequency of a quartz crystal due to the mass added by biomolecular binding.",
"D": "By analyzing the current generated by the interaction of biomolecules with electrodes on a quartz crystal."
},
"answer": "C",
"explanation": "A QCM biosensor relies on a piezoelectric quartz crystal that vibrates at a specific resonant frequency. When biomolecules bind to the surface of the crystal, they increase its mass, causing a decrease in the resonant frequency. This frequency change is directly proportional to the mass of the bound biomolecules, allowing for their detection and quantification."

"question": "What is the relationship between the resonant frequency change and the mass change in a Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) biosensor?",
"options": {
"A": "Exponential relationship",
"B": "Logarithmic relationship",
"C": "Inverse square relationship",
"D": "Linear relationship"
},
"answer": "D",
"explanation": "In a QCM biosensor, the change in resonant frequency is linearly proportional to the change in mass on the crystal surface. This linear relationship makes it possible to directly correlate the measured frequency shift with the amount of biomolecules bound to the sensor."
