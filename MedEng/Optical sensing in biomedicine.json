    "question": "What is Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The transfer of energy from an excited molecule to a ground-state molecule through radiative emission",
      "B": "The transfer of energy between two molecules through collisions",
      "C": "The non-radiative transfer of energy from an excited donor molecule to an acceptor molecule",
      "D": "The absorption of light by a molecule followed by the emission of light at a longer wavelength"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) involves the non-radiative transfer of energy from an excited donor molecule to an acceptor molecule. This transfer occurs when the emission spectrum of the donor overlaps with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor, and the molecules are in close proximity."

      "C": "100-1000 nm",
      "D": "1-10 μm"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "For efficient FRET, the donor and acceptor molecules need to be in close proximity. The typical distance range for FRET to occur is between 1 and 10 nanometers."

  {
    "question": "How is FRET used as a molecular ruler?",
    "options": {
      "A": "By measuring the intensity of the donor emission",
      "B": "By measuring the lifetime of the donor excitation state",
      "C": "By directly measuring the distance between the donor and acceptor",
      "D": "By measuring the intensity of the acceptor emission"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The efficiency of FRET is highly sensitive to the distance between the donor and acceptor molecules. By measuring the lifetime of the donor's excited state, which is influenced by FRET, researchers can indirectly determine the distance between the two molecules, making FRET a valuable molecular ruler."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Fluorescent dyes are frequently employed in biological imaging due to their ability to enhance contrast and provide molecule-specific visualization. The intrinsic fluorescence of biological samples (autofluorescence) is often weak, making exogenous dyes essential for clear imaging."
