"answer": "C",
"explanation": "Succinate is oxidized to fumarate in Complex II of the electron transport chain, donating electrons to coenzyme Q. While Complex II itself does not pump protons, the subsequent electron transfer through Complexes III and IV contributes to the proton gradient, driving ATP synthesis."

"question": "How does hydrogen sulfide (H2S) inhibit the electron transport chain?",
"options": {
"A": "It blocks the binding of NADH to Complex I.",
"B": "It inhibits the transfer of electrons from coenzyme Q to Complex III.",
"C": "It competes with oxygen for binding to the heme group in Complex IV, preventing electron transfer and oxygen reduction.",
"D": "It uncouples electron transport from ATP synthesis, dissipating the proton gradient."
},
"answer": "C",
"explanation": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a toxic gas, disrupts the electron transport chain by competing with oxygen for binding to the heme group in Complex IV. This competitive binding prevents oxygen from being reduced to water, halting electron flow and inhibiting ATP synthesis."

"question": "What is the mechanism of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning in relation to the electron transport chain?",
"options": {
"A": "CO inhibits Complex I, blocking electron transfer from NADH.",
"B": "CO disrupts the Q cycle in Complex III, impairing proton translocation.",
"C": "CO binds to cytochrome c, preventing electron transfer to Complex IV.",
"D": "CO competes with oxygen for binding to Complex IV, inhibiting oxygen reduction and halting electron transport."
},
"answer": "D",
"explanation": "Carbon monoxide (CO) exerts its toxic effects by binding to Complex IV in the electron transport chain, competing with oxygen for the same binding site. This competitive binding disrupts oxygen reduction, leading to a halt in electron transport and a critical reduction in ATP production."
