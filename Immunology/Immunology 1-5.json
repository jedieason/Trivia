    "question": "TdT (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) adds N-nucleotides during gene rearrangement. What is the effect of N-nucleotide addition on antigen receptor diversity?",
    "options": {
      "A": "It reduces diversity by creating non-functional reading frames.",

    "question": "What is the consequence of a 'nonproductive join' during light chain gene rearrangement?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The B cell is immediately triggered to undergo apoptosis.",
      "B": "The B cell proceeds to express both kappa and lambda light chains.",

      "E": "The B cell matures but expresses a low affinity BCR."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) A 'nonproductive join' means that the gene rearrangement resulted in a reading frame shift or stop codon, leading to a non-functional light chain. In such cases, the B cell has a chance to rearrange the light chain genes on the other allele. This is a rescue mechanism to achieve a functional light chain."
  },
  {
    "question": "Refer to the diagram of 'Number of functional gene segments in human immunoglobulin loci'. Which immunoglobulin chain locus has D (Diversity) gene segments?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Kappa light chain locus (κ)",

    "options": {
      "A": "To induce negative selection of self-reactive Pre-B cells.",
      "B": "To trigger apoptosis of Pre-B cells lacking functional heavy chains.",
      "C": "To initiate light chain gene rearrangement and promote Pre-B cell proliferation.",
      "D": "To facilitate migration of Pre-B cells out of the bone marrow.",
      "E": "To directly activate effector functions of Pre-B cells."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) Cross-linking of Pre-BCR molecules, mediated by the unique termini of VpreB and λ5, is essential for signaling.

    "options": {
      "A": "It undergoes somatic hypermutation to improve receptor expression.",
      "B": "It is redirected to differentiate into a T cell instead.",
      "C": "It undergoes apoptosis due to lack of essential survival signals.",
      "D": "It becomes anergic but can still mature into a functional B cell.",
      "E": "It remains in the Pro-B cell stage indefinitely."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) Pro-B cells that fail to express Pre-BCR and consequently do not receive the necessary survival signals are destined for apoptosis (programmed cell death). This is a crucial checkpoint to eliminate cells that have not successfully rearranged their heavy chain genes and cannot form a functional pre-receptor."

  {
    "question": "Allelic exclusion is a crucial process to ensure clonal specificity. What is the molecular mechanism that initially prevents rearrangement of the second heavy chain allele after successful rearrangement of the first allele?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Increased expression of RAG-1/2 recombinase activity on the second allele.",
      "B": "Reduced accessibility of the second heavy chain locus to recombinase machinery.",
      "C": "Epigenetic silencing of the second heavy chain allele through methylation.",
      "D": "Increased degradation of the second heavy chain locus DNA.",
      "E": "Transcriptional activation of inhibitory genes specifically targeting the second allele."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "(B)  While the exact mechanisms are complex, a key aspect of allelic exclusion involves reducing the accessibility of the second heavy chain locus to the RAG recombinase machinery after a successful rearrangement on the first allele. This reduced accessibility is thought to involve changes in chromatin structure and locus contraction, making it less likely for the second allele to be rearranged."

    "question": "In the context of allelic exclusion, what is the outcome of a rabbit experiment involving homozygous strains (a/a and b/b) and their heterozygous offspring (a/b)?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Heterozygous offspring express both a and b heavy chain alleles in every B cell.",
      "B": "Heterozygous offspring express either a or b heavy chain alleles in individual B cells, but not both.",
      "C": "Heterozygous offspring express a mixture of a and b heavy chain alleles in each B cell.",
      "D": "Heterozygous offspring preferentially express the a allele over the b allele in all B cells.",
      "E": "Heterozygous offspring fail to express any functional heavy chain alleles due to allelic exclusion."

  {
    "question": "During receptor editing, what is the INITIAL cellular response of an immature B cell that strongly recognizes a self-antigen in the bone marrow?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Immediate apoptosis to prevent autoimmunity.",
      "B": "Class switch recombination to change antibody isotype.",
      "C": "Downregulation of surface IgM expression and continued light chain rearrangement.",
      "D": "Upregulation of RAG gene expression to enhance heavy chain rearrangement.",
      "E": "Migration to the periphery to undergo peripheral tolerance mechanisms."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) When an immature B cell strongly reacts to self-antigen, the first step in receptor editing is to downregulate surface IgM expression. Critically, RAG genes remain active, allowing the B cell to continue light chain gene rearrangement in an attempt to generate a new, non-self-reactive light chain and BCR."
  },
  {
    "question": "If receptor editing fails to produce a non-self-reactive BCR, what is the ultimate fate of the immature B cell?",
    "options": {
      "A": "It becomes an anergic B cell in the bone marrow.",
      "B": "It migrates to the periphery and becomes clonally ignorant.",
      "C": "It undergoes apoptosis (clonal deletion).",
      "D": "It differentiates into a regulatory B cell to suppress autoimmunity.",
      "E": "It remains in the bone marrow as a memory B cell precursor."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) If receptor editing attempts fail to produce a non-self-reactive BCR, the immature B cell will ultimately undergo apoptosis, a process known as clonal deletion. This is a fail-safe mechanism to eliminate potentially autoreactive B cells that receptor editing could not rescue."

      "A": "Anergic B cells express higher levels of surface IgM and IgD.",
      "B": "Anergic B cells are highly proliferative and readily undergo clonal expansion.",
      "C": "Anergic B cells are unresponsive to antigen stimulation and have reduced migratory capacity.",
      "D": "Anergic B cells preferentially secrete IgA antibodies.",
      "E": "Anergic B cells have an extended lifespan compared to normal B cells."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) Anergic B cells are functionally inactivated or silenced. They are characterized by their unresponsiveness to antigen stimulation, reduced migratory capacity (poorly migrate to lymphoid follicles), and shortened lifespan. They represent a state of tolerance induced by weak or soluble self-antigen recognition."
  },
  {
    "question": "Immunological ignorance is another mechanism of B cell tolerance. Under what circumstances might a clonally ignorant B cell become activated?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Upon encountering soluble self-antigens at high concentrations.",
      "B": "After migrating to the thymus for further negative selection.",
      "C": "In the presence of inflammation or very high concentrations of self-antigen.",
      "D": "Through strong cross-linking of their BCRs by multivalent self-antigens.",
      "E": "By receiving T cell help in the absence of antigen stimulation."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) Clonally ignorant B cells are typically non-reactive because they do not encounter their cognate self-antigen at sufficient concentrations or in an immunogenic context under normal conditions. However, in specific situations like inflammation (which can increase antigen presentation and co-stimulation) or very high concentrations of self-antigen, these B cells *can* be activated, potentially leading to autoimmunity."

  {
    "question": "In central tolerance, B cell fates are determined in the bone marrow. What are the potential outcomes for immature B cells in the bone marrow based on their reactivity to self-antigens?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Survival and maturation, receptor editing, clonal deletion, anergy.",
      "B": "Only survival and maturation or clonal deletion.",

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "(A) In the bone marrow, immature B cells encountering self-antigens can have several fates: *survival and maturation* if non-reactive, *receptor editing* to change receptor specificity, *clonal deletion* (apoptosis) if strongly self-reactive, or *anergy* (functional inactivation) if weakly self-reactive. These are the primary mechanisms of central tolerance."

  {
    "question": "In peripheral tolerance, what happens to transitional B cells that encounter multivalent self-molecules in the periphery?",
    "options": {
      "A": "They undergo receptor editing in the spleen.",
      "B": "They differentiate into marginal zone B cells.",
      "C": "They undergo apoptosis (clonal deletion).",

      "E": "They mature into follicular B cells and gain self-tolerance."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) In peripheral tolerance, transitional B cells that encounter multivalent self-molecules, which indicate strong self-reactivity, undergo apoptosis. This peripheral clonal deletion mechanism removes self-reactive B cells that may have escaped central tolerance in the bone marrow."

  {
    "question": "What is the fate of transitional B cells that encounter soluble self-antigens in the periphery?",
    "options": {
      "A": "They undergo clonal deletion.",

      "C": "They become anergic and eventually die if they cannot enter B cell follicles.",
      "D": "They mature into marginal zone B cells for rapid responses.",
      "E": "They initiate class switch recombination in the spleen."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) Transitional B cells that encounter soluble self-antigens in the periphery become anergic. These anergic B cells are then unable to efficiently enter B cell follicles in the spleen, and without follicular entry and survival signals, they eventually die. This is a mechanism of peripheral anergy induction."

      "D": "High affinity interaction with T cells in the T cell zone.",
      "E": "MHC class II presentation of foreign antigens in the spleen."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) BAFF (B-cell activating factor), secreted by follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in the spleen follicles, is a critical survival signal for transitional B cells. To mature into follicular B cells, they must enter follicles and receive this BAFF signal via their BAFF receptor. Without BAFF, they will not survive and mature."
