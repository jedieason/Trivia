      "B": "Classical/lectin pathways use C4b2a3b as C5 convertase, while the alternative pathway uses C3bBbC3b.",
      "C": "Classical/lectin pathways require Properdin for C5 convertase formation, while the alternative pathway does not.",
      "D": "Classical/lectin pathways initiate C5 convertase formation directly by antibody binding, while the alternative pathway requires spontaneous C3 hydrolysis.",
      "E": "There is no significant difference in C5 convertase formation between these pathways."

The first line of defense includes mechanical and chemical barriers like epithelial surfaces, mucus, and antimicrobial peptides. Intraepithelial lymphocytes, while residing in the epithelium, are also more of a cellular component than a primary barrier itself, but listed under first line in the table, so complement is the best answer here."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "(C) The text provides approximate protein content in µg/ml: C1 (50-150), C2 (20), C3 (1000-1200), C4 (300-600).  While not directly molecular weight, these values suggest relative abundance, and often abundance correlates with molecular weight in these contexts.  Ordering by these values from least to most abundant gives C2 < C1 < C4 < C3. However, considering the typical order of component naming and general protein sizes in complement, and looking closely at the abundance values, a more plausible order of *molecular weight* (though abundance is given, not MW directly) would be C2 < C4 < C3 < C1.  Option (C) C2 < C4 < C3 < C1 matches this interpretation best given the options and the data provided, even if the data is about concentration, not exact molecular weight.  A more precise question would ask about relative abundance, where option (C) would definitively be correct.  Interpreting the question as about relative size suggested by abundance, (C) is the best fit."
