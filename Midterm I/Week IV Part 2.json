    "explanation": "Oseltamivir and zanamivir are neuraminidase inhibitors that structurally mimic sialic acid residues. They compete with the natural substrate, preventing neuraminidase from cleaving sialic acid and releasing new viral particles."

    "question": "What is the main factor contributing to the higher susceptibility of blood type O individuals to Helicobacter pylori infection?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Weakened immune responses in blood type O individuals",
      "B": "Increased expression of receptors for H. pylori in blood type O individuals",
      "C": "Higher stomach acidity in blood type O individuals",
      "D": "Stronger binding affinity of H. pylori lectin to oligosaccharides on type O red blood cells"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The lectin on H. pylori exhibits a stronger binding affinity for the specific oligosaccharides present on the surface of red blood cells in individuals with blood type O, making them more vulnerable to infection."

    "question": "What is glycomics?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The study of all genes in an organism",
      "B": "The study of all proteins in an organism",
      "C": "The study of all carbohydrates in an organism",
      "D": "The study of all lipids in an organism"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Glycomics is the comprehensive study of all carbohydrates, including those linked to proteins and lipids (glycoproteins and glycolipids), within a given cell type or organism."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is glycomics considered more complex than genomics or proteomics?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Carbohydrates are more diverse in structure than proteins or nucleic acids.",
      "B": "Carbohydrates are more difficult to isolate and purify than proteins or nucleic acids.",
      "C": "Carbohydrate synthesis is more complex than protein or nucleic acid synthesis.",
      "D": "Determining the complete structure of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides requires analyzing multiple aspects, including branching, linkage types, and monomer configurations."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Glycomics involves analyzing not only the linear sequence of sugars but also their branching patterns, linkage types, and anomeric configurations, making it a more intricate field compared to genomics or proteomics."
