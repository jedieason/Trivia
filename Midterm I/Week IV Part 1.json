      "D": "Sugar molecules with an amino group attached"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Lactones are cyclic esters formed from aldonic or uronic acids, where the carboxyl group reacts with a hydroxyl group within the same molecule to form a ring structure."

    "question": "What is a key characteristic of sialic acids?",
    "options": {
      "A": "They have a five-carbon backbone",
      "B": "They are neutral sugars",
      "C": "They are commonly found in plant cell walls",
      "D": "They have a nine-carbon backbone"

  {
    "question": "What is the abbreviation for glucose?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Glu",
      "B": "Glc",
      "C": "Gal",
      "D": "Man"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The standard abbreviation for glucose is \"Glc\". This is an exception to the general rule of using the first three letters of the sugar name, likely to avoid confusion with amino acid abbreviations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does \"NAc\" indicate in the abbreviation of a sugar?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The presence of a nitrogen atom",
      "B": "N-linked acetylation",
      "C": "The presence of an acetyl group",
      "D": "The sugar is an acid"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "In sugar abbreviations, \"NAc\" stands for N-linked acetylation, signifying the addition of an acetyl group to a nitrogen atom."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a reducing sugar?",
    "options": {
      "A": "A sugar that can donate electrons to another molecule",
      "B": "A sugar that has been broken down into smaller units",
      "C": "A sugar that cannot be further oxidized",
      "D": "A sugar that is only found in reducing environments"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "A reducing sugar is a sugar that can act as a reducing agent, meaning it can donate electrons to another chemical species, typically a metal ion. This ability often stems from the presence of a free aldehyde or ketone group."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the principle behind Fehling's test for detecting reducing sugars?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The change in color of a copper-containing solution upon reduction",
      "B": "The formation of a precipitate when the sugar reacts with an acid",
      "C": "The change in pH of the solution when the sugar is added",
      "D": "The measurement of the optical rotation of the sugar solution"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Fehling's test relies on the reduction of copper ions (Cu²⁺) in a blue solution to copper(I) oxide (Cu₂O), which forms a reddish precipitate. This color change indicates the presence of a reducing sugar."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are only linear forms of sugars detected in Fehling's test?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cyclic sugars cannot reduce copper ions",
      "B": "The equilibrium between linear and cyclic forms favors the linear form in the test conditions",
      "C": "Fehling's reagent only reacts with the aldehyde group in the linear form",
      "D": "Cyclic sugars are too large to interact with Fehling's reagent"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "While both linear and cyclic forms of sugars exist in solution, Fehling's test specifically detects the linear form because the reaction involves the oxidation of the aldehyde group, which is only present in the linear form."
  },
  {
    "question": "What functional group in sugars is primarily responsible for their reducing ability?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hydroxyl group",
      "B": "Carboxyl group",
      "C": "Aldehyde group",
      "D": "Ether group"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The aldehyde group (-CHO) is primarily responsible for the reducing ability of sugars in tests like Fehling's test. It can be oxidized to a carboxyl group, while reducing another chemical species."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are ketones generally not considered reducing sugars?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ketones lack a carbonyl group",
      "B": "Ketones cannot be oxidized under any conditions",
      "C": "Ketones do not react with copper ions",
      "D": "Ketones cannot exist in a linear form"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Ketones, while possessing a carbonyl group, do not readily undergo oxidation under the conditions of Fehling's test, unlike aldehydes. Therefore, they are not typically classified as reducing sugars."
