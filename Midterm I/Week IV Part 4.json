      "C": "The reaction is irreversible in both humans and fermenting organisms.",
      "D": "The reaction is reversible in both humans and fermenting organisms, but it is more efficient in fermenting organisms."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Organisms capable of ethanol fermentation possess both alcohol dehydrogenase and pyruvate decarboxylase. This allows them to run the pathway in reverse, producing pyruvate from ethanol. However, humans lack pyruvate decarboxylase, so they can only convert ethanol to acetaldehyde, not the reverse."
